# Game---Noita-


Noita is an platform roguelite game developed by Nolla Games. The game takes place in a 2D world with procedurally generated areas where every pixel is physically simulated. In Noita, element like fire and water are simulated. The aim of this work is the simulation of different elements (sand, water, wood, rock, smoke, fire, acid and salt) and the interaction between them.
