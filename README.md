# Game---Noita-


Noita is an platform roguelite game developed by Nolla Games. The game takes place in a 2D world with procedurally generated areas where every pixel is physically simulated. In Noita, element like fire and water are simulated. The aim of this work is the simulation of different elements and interactions between them.

In this project, 8 elements are simulated and are used thanks to keyboard keys:
- Sand : w key
- Water : x key 
- Wood : a key
- Rock : t key
- Smoke : z key
- Fire : r key
- Acid : y key
- Salt : e key


The following interactions are simulated:
- Wood and fire : the fire spreads into the wood
- Fire and smoke : fire generates smoke
- Water and sand : water rises when it is under sand and sand sink when it is above the water
- Salt and water : salt rises when it is under water
- Acid and any element (except rock): acid erase any element under it



Special actions can be done :
- Zoom in : h key 
- Zoom out : g key
- Erase a pixel : b key
- Move the window to the right : rght arrow
- Move the window to the left : lft arrow
- Move up the window : up arrow
- Move down the window : down arrow
